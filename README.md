# Customer Relationship Management(CRM)
This is a very basic CRM project, it allow user to filter customer by name.

# Architecture Detail
Since it's very basic, I decided to use Server side render HTML, it make the development easier. But ideally I would love to use ReactJS and deploy it on node.js server as client

# Technologies
* ruby 2.3.1

* rails 5.1.5 

* Mysql

* Twitter bootstrap

# Installation

Generate customers data, it's default 100 record
 ```
rake customer:fake_data 
 ```
